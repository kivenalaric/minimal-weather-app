# minimal-weather-app

Its a minimal app with just some basic informations and functionalities.

## How to run project
clone the project

Inside that directory (theweather), you can run several commands:
  run npm install
    install all dependencies
    
  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd theweather
  npm start

Happy hacking!
